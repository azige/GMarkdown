# Mages

Mages is a static web site generator using groovy script and markdown.

Groovy script make it easy to use templates or i18n and it's possible to
extend functions by plugin.

Markdown, just as you know, is a popular language to generate html.
This project uses [pegdown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown) to convert
markdown to html.
